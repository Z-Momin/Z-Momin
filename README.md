Hello,

My name is Zafir Momin and I am currently completing my Masters in Data Science at NYU at the Center for Data Science. I am currently looking for internships and full time opportunities in Data Science and Machine Learning roles. 

I am a Python veteran and am familiar with data visualization and wrangling packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. I have extensive knowledge of machine learning and deep learning frameworks, (i.e. SciKit-Learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow etc). I am knowledgeable in Big Data as I have the skillset to work with large datasets, database systems, SQL, and High Performance Computing (HPC) on NYU, Flatiron Institute, and GCP clusters. I also have experience with PySpark and Hadoop.

Some projects that I would like to highlight are featured below:

Introduction to Data Science Final Project: [Skynet's Racetrack](https://github.com/Z-Momin/IDS---Final-Project) - [[Paper]](https://github.com/Z-Momin/IDS---Final-Project/blob/master/IDSFinalPaper.pdf)

Big Data Final Project: [Million Song Dataset Rec Sys](https://github.com/Z-Momin/MSD-RecSys) - [[Paper]](https://github.com/Z-Momin/MSD-RecSys/blob/main/FinalReport.pdf)

My relevant coursework includes:
- Probability and Statistics
- Programming for Data Science
- Introduction to Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Text as Data in R
- Deep Learning
- ML Tools and Techniques
- Introduction to Database Systems
- Introduction to Deep Learning Systems

Please let me know if you have any questions. You can reach me at my personal email: *zm2114@nyu.edu*.
