Hello,

My name is Zafir Momin and I am a currently a Data Scientist at Astraea Inc. I have a B.S. in Physics and a M.S. in Data Science from NYU. 

I am a Python veteran and am familiar with data visualization and wrangling packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. I have extensive knowledge of machine learning and deep learning frameworks, (i.e. SciKit-Learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow etc). I am knowledgeable in Big Data as I have the skillset to work with large datasets, database systems, SQL, and High Performance Computing (HPC) on clusters. I also have experience with PySpark and Hadoop.

Some projects that I would like to highlight are featured below:

[Skynet's Racetrack](https://github.com/Z-Momin/IDS---Final-Project) - [[Paper]](https://github.com/Z-Momin/IDS---Final-Project/blob/master/IDSFinalPaper.pdf)
  Using the Car Racing environemnt from OpenAI Gym, we used machine learning and deep learning to create models that learn how to drive around the track from human players. We achieved 75% and 99% accuracy on our best machine learning and best deep learning models respectively.  

[Million Song Dataset Rec Sys](https://github.com/Z-Momin/MSD-RecSys) - [[Paper]](https://github.com/Z-Momin/MSD-RecSys/blob/main/FinalReport.pdf)

[Applications of Neural Radiance Fields in Astronomy - Paper](https://github.com/Z-Momin/Capstone/blob/main/FinalReport.pdf)

My relevant coursework includes:
- Probability and Statistics
- Programming for Data Science
- Introduction to Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Text as Data in R
- Deep Learning
- ML Tools and Techniques
- Introduction to Database Systems
- Introduction to Deep Learning Systems
